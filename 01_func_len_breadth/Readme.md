# Assignment no: 01

** Write two programs to find the area, perimeter of a rectangle, when length and breadth is given. **

ie, when this code it run, proper result should be returned to area_value and perimeter_value

```
length = 12;
breadth = 14;
area_value = area(length, breadth);
perimeter_value = perimeter(length, breadth);
```

## Instructions:

1. Create a folder under your name (underscore seperated names like `adarsh_k_v`) in this folder (`01_func_len_breadth`). All your files and works should be done under that folder.
  1. create a file area.py and write a function which when called with parameters return the area of a rectangle.
  2. create a file perimeter.py and write a function which when called with parameters return perimeter of a rectangle.
  3. Create a Readme.md file, and write down all your notes there.
    * seach what a `Markdown` language is - refer: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

2. signature should be
  1. fn area(length: int, breadth: int) : int
  2. fn perimeter(length: int, breadth: int) : int
    * search what a function signature is, and write it in the Readme.md file.

3. ** IMPORTANT: ** all your files should be under that single folder (`your_user_name`).

We can discuss your code, ask questions and learn, with collaboration from your friends.
