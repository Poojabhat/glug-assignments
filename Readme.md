# Assignments

* This is a humble try to give students who have attended the python class held at PACE, some hands on experience with python.

* With this effort I am hoping to give Github experience to you all.
  * Github is a Version control system(VCS), and when you work with real programs you have to use one or another VCS.
  * Alone with that we will learn many other programing concepts.
  * Discussions on code, code review, Peer review and pull requests will be done.

* Those who are interested, please,

  1. Fork this repository ( there will be a Fork button on this page at top right. )
    * I am asuming that you already have created your github account.

  2. Clone from the forked repository(repo) in your github profile.

  3. create a folder of your name (underscore seperated) under the respective assignment folder.

  4. cd to that folder and start working with what the Readme.md file has said about the assignment.

  5. Once you are done with the code, send me a `Pull Request`.
    *  Don't worry, I will run you through this process once you are done with the coding part.

* You can ask me questions here at Github itself.
